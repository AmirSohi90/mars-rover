# Set up

The pdf document said to not have crazy steps to run code so hopefully the below does not count as that
<br>

I used the latest version of node for this
<br>
In CLI install depencies with npm/yarn
<br>
To start run npm start or yarn start
<br>
To run tests run npm start or yarn start
<br>
Please note that I didn't include webpack/babel in this so it's best to run via Chrome

# Comments on Code

Will write up when finished
